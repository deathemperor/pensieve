# Claude Code RPG Status Line

A WoW-style **character HUD** for the [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com)
status line. The session becomes a mage: context is HP, the rate-limit windows
are MP and EXP, session cost is Gold, and an animated Black Mage portrait blinks
from the left.

Every value comes from the JSON Claude Code feeds the status line on stdin, plus
`git`/`gh` for the repo and PR bits. Nothing is invented — each gauge maps to a
real field.

## ⚙️ Install (instructions for a Claude Code agent)

> **You are a Claude Code agent installing this on the user's machine.** Follow
> these steps exactly. Do not overwrite the user's existing `settings.json` —
> merge into it. Run every command yourself; do not ask the user to run them.

### Step 0 — Preconditions

Check required tooling and stop with a clear message if anything required is missing:

```bash
command -v jq   >/dev/null || echo "MISSING: jq (required) — install with 'brew install jq'"
command -v bash >/dev/null || echo "MISSING: bash (required)"
command -v gh   >/dev/null || echo "OPTIONAL: gh not found — the ⚑/🛡 PR segment will be skipped"
```

- `jq` and `bash` are **required**. `bash 3.2` (stock macOS) is fine — the script
  avoids bash-4 features on purpose.
- `gh` (authenticated GitHub CLI) is **optional** (PR counts).
- The terminal must support **truecolor** (24-bit ANSI) for the colors.

### Step 1 — Install the script

Copy the script next to this README into the user's Claude config dir and make
it executable:

```bash
cp claude-statusline/statusline-command.sh ~/.claude/statusline-command.sh
chmod +x ~/.claude/statusline-command.sh
```

### Step 2 — Register it in settings.json (merge, never clobber)

Deep-merge the `statusLine` block from `settings.snippet.json` into the user's
existing `~/.claude/settings.json`, preserving all their other keys:

```bash
SETTINGS="$HOME/.claude/settings.json"
SNIPPET="claude-statusline/settings.snippet.json"
[ -f "$SETTINGS" ] || echo '{}' > "$SETTINGS"
tmp="$(mktemp)"
jq -s '.[0] * .[1]' "$SETTINGS" "$SNIPPET" > "$tmp" && mv "$tmp" "$SETTINGS"
```

The snippet is:

```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "bash ~/.claude/statusline-command.sh",
    "refreshInterval": 3
  }
}
```

**Verify the merge produced valid JSON and the key is present:**

```bash
jq -e '.statusLine.command' ~/.claude/settings.json
```

If `jq -e` exits non-zero, the merge failed — restore from the user's git/editor
history and retry; do **not** leave a broken `settings.json`.

### Step 3 — Smoke-test the render

Feed the script a minimal sample of the status-line JSON and confirm it prints
two lines without errors:

```bash
echo '{
  "session_id":"test","cwd":"'"$HOME"'","effort":{"level":"high"},
  "session_name":"Install check","model":{"display_name":"Opus 4.8"},
  "workspace":{"current_dir":"'"$HOME"'","repo":{"owner":"o","name":"demo"}},
  "cost":{"total_cost_usd":1.5,"total_duration_ms":600000,"total_lines_added":10,"total_lines_removed":2},
  "context_window":{"remaining_percentage":67},"exceeds_200k_tokens":false,"thinking":{"enabled":true},
  "rate_limits":{"five_hour":{"used_percentage":20,"resets_at":9999999999},"seven_day":{"used_percentage":40,"resets_at":9999999999}}
}' | bash ~/.claude/statusline-command.sh
```

Expect two ANSI-colored lines (HP/MP/EXP gauges, a `🪄` hero, a Black Mage
portrait). If it errors, check `jq` is installed and the script is `bash`-run.

### Step 4 — Tell the user

Report that the HUD is installed and will appear after they **restart Claude
Code** (or start a new session). Mention the two knobs they're most likely to
want: `SPRITE_ENABLED=0` (drop the portrait) and `refreshInterval` (animation;
see below).

### Idempotency & re-runs

Re-running is safe: Step 1 overwrites the script with the same content, and the
Step 2 `jq` merge just re-sets the same `statusLine` key. Nothing is duplicated.

## HUD Legend

### Line 1 — your character

| Icon | Name | Meaning | Source |
|------|------|---------|--------|
| `▟██▙` / `▝••▘` | Portrait | Animated Black Mage (shimmers + blinks) | — |
| `🪄` *name* | **Hero** | The user (gold = the player) | system user |
| *class* | **Class** | Chosen WoW class in its class color (set via the [class chooser](#class-chooser)); falls back to the model, family-abbreviated + compacted (`O4.8`) | `~/.claude/.statusline-class` / `model.display_name` |
| `HP` (red) | **Life** | Context window **remaining** — drains as context fills; 0 = compaction | `context_window.remaining_percentage` |
| `MP` (blue) | **Mana** | 5-hour rate-limit left (`100 − used`) — recharges at reset | `rate_limits.five_hour` |
| `EXP` (yellow) `⭐Lv N` | **Level** | Bar = **current 7-day usage %** (reads 100% when maxed, never 0%); `⭐Lv N` banks completed weeks (see [How the Level is calculated](#how-the-level-is-calculated)); `⏳ Nd/Nh` reset cooldown shows **only when usage > 70%** | `rate_limits.seven_day` |
| `🔮` *level* | **Spell power** | Reasoning effort (low/medium/high) | `effort.level` |
| `⚔` `+N/-N` | **Damage dealt** | Lines added / removed this session | `cost.total_lines_*` |
| `🌀 Focus` | **Buff** | Extended thinking is on | `thinking.enabled` |
| `🎒 Encumbered` | **Debuff** | Context over 200k tokens | `exceeds_200k_tokens` |
| `⚡ Haste` | **Buff** | Fast mode is on (only shown when active) | `fast_mode` |

### Line 2 — stats & world

| Icon | Name | Meaning | Source |
|------|------|---------|--------|
| `🏰` *repo* | **Kingdom** | The repository being worked in | `workspace.repo.name` |
| `💰` *N*`G` | **Gold** | Session cost in USD (WoW gold), e.g. `💰 947.80G` | `cost.total_cost_usd` |
| `🕹` *N*`h` | **Playtime** | Total session wall-clock (whole hours) | `cost.total_duration_ms` |
| `⚑ N` | **Bounties** | Open PRs authored by the user in this repo | `gh` (cached) |
| `🛡 M` | **Trials** | PRs awaiting the user's review (only when > 0) | `gh` (cached) |
| `🏅`/`💀`/`⚔` | **Raid** (CI) | Current branch's checks: `🏅 Clear` (pass) · `💀 Wipe` (fail) · `⚔ Pull` (running); hidden when no checks | `gh` (cached) |
| `🗺` *path* | **Area** | Current folder (last 2 path parts) | `cwd` |
| `📜` *branch* | **Quest** | Git branch — a leading `✦` means uncommitted changes | git |
| `⛺` *name* | **Camp** | Active git worktree (a temporary base) | `worktree.name` |
| `📖 «…»` | **Tale** | Session name | `session_name` |

**Conditional segments** (appear only when present): `🎭` agent · `🔧` dev-mode ·
`🎨` output-style · `✏️` vim-mode · `📂` added-dirs · `⏳` weekly-reset cooldown (last, only when 7-day usage > 70%).

### Gauges & colors

- Each bar is an 8-cell gauge with the **percentage centered on a chip whose
  background matches the bar color** (dark digits for contrast).
- Fixed RPG colors: **HP = red, MP = blue, EXP = yellow.** Hero name is gold;
  class is mage class-blue.
- Long text (branch, session name, worktree) is clipped to ~24 chars with `…`
  so the line stays bounded and the compact stats never get pushed off-screen.

### How the Level is calculated

The feed only exposes the **rolling 7-day quota usage**
(`rate_limits.seven_day.used_percentage`, 0–100) — not a lifetime token count —
so the level is tracked locally:

- **The EXP bar = your current 7-day usage %.** It fills as you spend the week's
  quota and reads **100% when maxed**; it never shows 0% while you're using.
- **The level is DERIVED from time, not accumulated** (so it's race-proof across
  many concurrent sessions sharing one file). `seven_day.resets_at` advances ~7
  days each weekly rollover, so:
  **`Level = (current_reset − first_reset) / 604800 + 1`**, where `first_reset` is
  the earliest weekly-reset epoch ever seen. Every session computes the *same*
  level; ~1 level per week elapsed since you started.

State lives in `~/.claude/.statusline-level` — a single value, `first_reset`
(survives reboots). Writes use a per-PID temp file and only ever *lower*
`first_reset`, so concurrent sessions can't corrupt or over-count it. An old
4-field / corrupt file self-heals on read. Delete the file to reset to **Lv 1**.

**Reset cooldown:** when current usage is above 70%, `⏳ Nd/Nh` appears after the
level — the time until the weekly window refreshes — as a low-quota heads-up.

**Credit-burn animation:** the feed has **no "credits used" field**, so overage
is inferred. When you're at the weekly cap (bar = 100%) **and** the session cost
is rising, the EXP bar flickers like flame (yellow → orange → red) with a `🔥` —
you're actively spending pay-per-use credits. At the cap but idle (cost flat for
>15 s) it stays static. Below the cap it's plain yellow. Active-spend tracking
(`/tmp/claude-statusline-cost-<session>`) only runs while you're capped, so there
is no overhead the rest of the time.

> **Example:** hit 100% this week → `⭐Lv 2`, bar 100%, `⏳ 2d`. After the reset
> the bar drops to ~0% and `banked` becomes 100; the next full week dings
> `⭐Lv 3`.

## Class chooser

Pick a WoW vanilla class — it renders in that class's color where the model
normally shows. Run `statusline-class.sh`:

```bash
bash claude-statusline/statusline-class.sh          # interactive menu
bash claude-statusline/statusline-class.sh warrior  # set directly
bash claude-statusline/statusline-class.sh reset    # back to showing the model
```

Classes (icon · color): 🪓 Warrior · 🔨 Paladin · 🏹 Hunter · 🗡 Rogue ·
🙏 Priest · 🌩 Shaman · 🧙 Mage · 😈 Warlock · 🐻 Druid. The choice is stored in
`~/.claude/.statusline-class` (shared across profiles). Copy `statusline-class.sh`
next to the main script when installing.

---

## Special modes (transcript-derived)

The status-line feed has no task / sub-agent fields, but it does expose
`transcript_path` — the session's JSONL log. A background job (cached ~15 s,
per-session) parses it for two things:

### ⚔ Boss Fight

When the latest task list is **incomplete**, the run becomes a boss fight and **line 2 switches to a boss/target frame** (line 1 — your
character — stays). The objective is named after an iconic **WoW raid boss**,
chosen by a stable hash of the task contents (same task list → same boss). The
boss's **HP = remaining tasks** and drains as you complete them; when all tasks
are done the boss dies and line 2 returns to normal. During the fight, the
running sub-agents (Claude Teams) are shown as the **raid** attacking the boss —
`🚩 Raid(2): coder, apple` — from `Agent` tool_use ids without a `tool_result`.
A fight also expires if
the last task update is **> 15 min old** (Agent-teams doesn't always emit a final
all-done snapshot), and the boss **name is locked** for the whole fight.

Both task systems are supported: **`TodoWrite`** (a `todos` array snapshot) and
**Agent-teams `TaskCreate`/`TaskList`** (subject + status objects). The Task grep
only runs when there's no `TodoWrite`, so it adds no cost to TodoWrite sessions.

```
💀 Illidan  HP ███░░░░░ 40%  ⚔ 3/5 down  ▶ Doing task d
```

### 👥 Party / 🚩 Raid

Counts **currently-running sub-agents** (Claude Teams) — `Agent`/`Task` tool_use
ids in the transcript without a matching `tool_result`. **1–5 = 👥 Party**,
**> 5 = 🚩 Raid**; hidden when solo. Shown on line 1 with your character.

### ✨ Ambient magic

~6 % of renders, a random colored sparkle / rune (`✨ 💫 🌟 ❈ ✺ ⟡ ✧ ❉`) is
shown **at the wand** — the hero's `🪄` flickers into the sparkle for that
frame (the mage "casting"). Uses `$RANDOM`;
glyphs are chosen to avoid colliding with real HUD icons.

---

## `refreshInterval` (the animation)

`refreshInterval: 1` re-runs the script every second so the portrait animates
even while idle. Requires **Claude Code ≥ 2.1.97**. Remove the line to fall back
to event-driven updates (the portrait then only animates while Claude is
working). An agent installing on an older version should drop the
`refreshInterval` key during the Step 2 merge.

## Customization (where to edit in the script)

| Want to change | Edit |
|---|---|
| Disable the portrait | `SPRITE_ENABLED=0` near the top |
| Gauge width | `W=8` in `render_gauge()` |
| Which line a segment is on / order | the `l1` (line 1) and `info` (line 2) arrays near the bottom |
| Animation speed/pattern | the 6-frame `case` block in the sprite section |
| PR / CI cache TTL | the `120` in the "Bounties" / "Trial" blocks |
| Tokens per level | the `/ 100` and `% 100` in the "EXP / Level" block |

Transient cache files live in `/tmp/claude-statusline-*` (per-session frame
counter + per-repo PR/CI cache) and are disposable. The **level** total is the
one persistent piece of state — `~/.claude/.statusline-level` (`cum last ts`);
delete it to reset back to Lv 1.

## Notes for the implementing agent

- **Performance (critical for `refreshInterval: 1`):** the script runs every
  second in every pane. It extracts **all** feed fields in **one** `jq` call (not
  ~25 separate spawns), computes `date` once, and pushes git/gh/transcript work
  into **background-cached** jobs. Transcript scans are bounded with
  `tail -n 5000` (a full `jq -rs` slurp of a large transcript took **20 s** and
  piled up under the 1 s cadence, spiking load average into the hundreds). Never
  reintroduce a per-render `git status`, an unbounded transcript scan, or
  multiple `jq` calls.

- The script is **`bash 3.2`-safe** — keep it that way (no associative arrays,
  no `local -n` namerefs). macOS ships bash 3.2.
- Colors are stored as literal `\033` escapes and decoded once by a final
  `printf '%b'`. Follow that convention when adding segments.
- The PR segment shells to `gh` only **at most once per 120 s** in a detached
  background job (gated on a stamp file's mtime), and reads a cached value each
  render — never block the render on the network.
- Bar glyphs are single-width block elements (`█ ░ ▏ ▕`). Avoid ambiguous-width
  glyphs (e.g. `▰ ▱`) — they render double-width / hatched in many fonts and
  overflow the gauge.

## Credits

Built collaboratively with Claude Code. The mage portrait is colored ASCII
(half-block / box-drawing characters), not an image — terminals can't render
real pixel art in the status line.
